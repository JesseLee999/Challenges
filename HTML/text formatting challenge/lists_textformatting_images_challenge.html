    <h1>One-cup pancakes with blueberries</h1>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Crack the <strong>egg</strong> into a large mixing bowl, add the <strong>flour</strong>, <strong>milk</strong> and a tiny pinch of <strong>sea salt</strong>.</li>
        <li>Whisk everything together until you have a lovely smooth batter, then fold through the <strong>blueberries</strong>.</li>
        <li>Heat ½ a tablespoon of <strong>olive oil</strong> in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, carefully tilting the pan to spread the oil out evenly.</li>
        <li>Add a few ladles of batter to the pan, leaving space between each one so they have room to spread out slightly – each ladleful will make one pancake, and you’ll need to work in batches.</li>
        <li>Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until little bubbles appear on the surface and the bases are golden, then carefully flip them over.
        <li>When the pancakes are golden on both sides, remove to a plate.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, adding a little more oil to the pan between batches, if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes while they’re still hot, with a dollop of <strong>yoghurt</strong> and some extra fresh berries, if you like.</li>
      </ol>
